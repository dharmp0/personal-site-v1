            <p>I'm a junior at Wilfrid Laurier University pursuing a double degree in Computer Science and Business Administration, with a strong passion for <a href="#Projects">building</a> software that solves real-world problems.</p>

            <p>I've gained hands-on <a href="#Experience">experience</a> as a Software Engineer Intern at Riipen and a Strategic Marketing Analyst at the AI startup Learning Mode AI. I’m constantly exploring new <a href="#Skills">technologies</a> while working on creative projects that challenge and inspire me.</p>

            <p>Outside of coding, you’ll find me at the gym, watching or playing basketball, trying new food spots, or planning my next trip. I love collaborating on projects and meeting like-minded people, so feel free to reach out!</p>
